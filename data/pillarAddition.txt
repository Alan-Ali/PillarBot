The Source of Love is The Good Father, The Good Mother, The Living Way of Truth, The Good King/Queen. 
But what words can truly and completely describe them? Let them introduce themselves to you, so that you
 may know them beyond what words can contain.

prefixNum:2*
The key to heaven on earth is unconditional love. It has always been here, we only need to manifest it through the spirit of love that lives inside us. This source exists beyond space and time, yet it can flow in you, in the inner sanctum of your heart. The Infinite One delights in love, but has empowered us to make our own choices. But if you come seeking with a pure and sincere heart, the Good King will take residence inside you, and bring you joy, hope, and peace. All good things we share, and thus we participate in heaven and reject the way of exploitation, which only knows how to take or give with selfish motivation.
%
prefixNum:3*
These pillars are only a guide to the way of the everlasting love. An introduction to the everlasting love that exists beyond space and time, so that you may have love, joy, hope, and peace through the painful birthing process into ourselves as we are in heaven. We should live full of this everlasting love, and be good stewards to the planet and to each other. In this way, we start our community on an eternal foundation. It is being connected to the Source of Love, beyond space and time, yet inside us, and having a close relationship with the Good King, and to learn all of their ways, to manifest heaven on earth. The language exchange is love, and revelations come from the very heavens to awaken our spirits to the truth that is hidden in plain sight.
%
prefixNum:4*
This is radical acceptance of the divine, this radical acceptance of ourselves, this is radical acceptance of others. We can curse our fates, or we can learn from them. We can blame the divine for all our problems, or trust our true parents. We can love ourselves, or we can hate ourselves. We can love others, or hate others. We participate in creation, and must take ownership of what is manifested therein.
%
prefixNum:5*
The key to connection with the divine is trust. The key to a relationship with the divine is communion. Even the lonely tree becomes a forest.
%
prefixNum:6*
Failure is an opportunity to do better. Every time you fall and let the Good King pick you back up, the more you will find yourself growing into your heavenly self. These pillars are not to put weight on you, but to uplift you.
%
prefixNum:7*
There are multiple you, but you are still one. The mind is a you, the heart is a you, and your intuition is yet another you, but they are all you. In this way we are made in the image of the Good King, who holds the keys to infinity.
%
prefixNum:8*
Practice is never in vain. In the kingdom, the training hall is always open. The ways of love are like a dance, and the Infinite One, your dance partner.
%
prefixNum:9*
There are two common blunders along the path: one is not loving yourself, and the other is looking for heaven in other people. Instead, look for these things within.
%
prefixNum:10*
To act against love is to block yourself from receiving love. During these times, go to the Source of Love, and ask to be made anew. No matter how far you are lost, you can always return to the Source, for our divine parents will not forsake us.
&
pillarNum:1*
Be love. Begin wherever you find yourself each day. Remember, love is a state of being — an interconnectedness with the source and creation — not just a feeling. Not just a feeling, but the way. Not just the way, but a person that can live inside you. Do not look here nor there for the Infinite One. Instead, with a sincere heart, invite the Source of Love to take residence inside you, and in this way, both of you are found.
%
pillarNum:2*
Treat the Source of Love, the Good King/Queen, as your beloved, and develop your own personal relationship, one that is not reliant on anyone else; a sacred spring that quenches your thirst. For when you love them, you love the Infinite One. When you love yourself, you love the Infinite One. When you love others, you love the Infinite One. And the Infinite One loves you, too. It is easier to be a good person when you have, so develop that which cannot be taken away.
%
pillarNum:3*
Develop true compassion. Even if you are starting from a place of no compassion, you are presented every day with an opportunity to practice compassion for yourself, others, and the source who shares in all our pain. We are all suffering, even our enemies. Develop a complete compassion, and your heart will be shielded from hate.
%
pillarNum:4*
When you love even your enemies and those that hurt you; when you sincerely include them in your wishes to the source, for the best for everyone; you are a true citizen and ambassador of love. The community is not just for its citizens, it is a beacon against hate and exploitation, and an open invitation to come and take part in love, in community. Mutual acceptance is powerful. This world has us all competing against each other, for its easier to prey on us if we’re scattered. So may we be an united, strong, and growing community to make it that much harder for those who would exploit us all.
%
pillarNum:5*
Love is patient; love is kind; love is understanding; love is honest; love is humble; love is unselfish; love is merciful; love is compassionate; love desires peace with others; love does not envy nor holds grudges; love helps those in need; love does not wish harm on anyone; love wants the best for everyone. Remember this, and that the secret to love is forgiveness, as there are those who would abuse you by falsely appearing as love.
%
pillarNum:6*
Treat nature as you would a loving mother. When you were helpless, she gave you food and shelter. Care about nature’s health, and treat all life with respect.
%
pillarNum:7*
To be true to love is to take part in the offensive against the exploitative one, to shine in the darkness. They value control above all else. Do not wait to shine in the darkness, for they seek to gather us up and bind us while we are yet asleep.
%
pillarNum:8*
Imagine purest light, imagine purest warmth, imagine complete acceptance, imagine complete surrender to the love from the Source of Love. May your connection be a living tree with roots that run deep down into the primordial aquifer; ready for the many storms and droughts of life. When there is more than one sharing in the source, the roots of the community form a mighty network. Thus the forest grows and restores the Earth with it.
%
pillarNum:9*
Love does not seek to change your personality. To be fully you when you give, is to give without conceit. Give, because the other person needs it. We do these things out of our true love, for the one who loves us beyond space and time, whom we are a part of. It is inside you, it is inside the person next to you, and in the person far away. It takes a seeking heart, it takes awareness, it takes being still on the inside, to hear the beating heart of the infinite one. So when you strike someone, you strike the Infinite One, which in turn is to strike yourself. So avoid hitting yourself, and give yourself a hand.
%
pillarNum:10*
Accept yourself, others, and their beliefs as they are, without accepting unloving intentions and actions as okay. With patience and kindness, simply make your case, but be quick to forgive. Do not expect anyone to change, whether they change is not up to you. We all have a shadow self, and the shadow self is like a child, the self that you hide from yourself and others, and you do not kill your child; you teach it why certain things are not good to do, and you teach it to use its words instead of lashing out. But you have to give it the space, and take the time to work things out. People equate certain opposites as evil, but evil is what evil does and schemes to do. Do not abandon yourself, raise your shadow with love and care. Do this filled with love. In this way, the darkness in your shadow transforms, and there is only you.
%
pillarNum:11*
It is inevitable that even the best among us need to return to the source to cleanse themselves on the inside. Willpower is not an infinite resource, and it only takes a moment for your heart to become poisoned by that which is against love. Surrender yourself to the Source of Love and be made clean and detoxified. This a new beginning to affirm your relationship with the source and return no longer alone. Become acquainted to the point where it’s more than words that are exchanged, but hearts. Such a person has transcended words, and is finally ready to start learning mysteries beyond them.
%
pillarNum:12*
Serving others is to free yourself from your own prison. Take off the pressure and the spotlight that you put on yourself, and use your floodlight to see that you are very much not alone in your suffering. Easing someone else’s pain will ease your own.
%
pillarNum:13*
We must see to it that even the poorest have food, water, clothing, respect, safety, shelter, and community. Would you not want the same if you were in their circumstances? Even taking small steps towards this goal will increase your capacity to actively love.
%
pillarNum:14*
Treat reality as a surprise unfolding into a surprise, and the Source of Love as a master weaver, who will sew your greatest story if you hand over the needle and thread — and if you do — you will have the courage to awaken to your spirituality.
%
pillarNum:15*
Develop your compass, for there are many directions that the heart may go. A working compass requires more than mind, heart, instinct, and intuition. This requires being sensitive to the Source of Love, that exists inside you and beyond you, to the warmth, to your connection. When you are in harmony with the Source of Love, you will find heaven inside you.
%
pillarNum:16*
If you cannot respond to a situation or person with love, do your best to do no harm. Forgive before returning. Yet try to not let a rift between you remain. It is good not to hold a grudge, but to leave another in their grudge is the same as leaving them in a cell. Always use your best judgement and be connected with the source in all things, for sometimes a situation or person needs space before they will be open to reconciliation. Before you approach, confirm that you are sober of heart, that your heart is not intoxicated by that which is against love. So too, consider deeply whether or not there truly is a conflict between you or in the situation, for sometimes the only enemies and conflicts are in our own minds. As for what happens after you have given the situation love and care: leave the rest in the hands of the source and go on with your day.
%
pillarNum:17*
Let go of the need to control the thoughts, opinions, and actions of others. With prudence, share your way, if it is indeed good. But the right of self-expression is sacred. However, self-expression is not an excuse to do wrong.
%
pillarNum:18*
We are to be each other’s guardians and defenders. Possess no less cunning than the exploiter, but never be like them. They take from others without caring about the other person’s well-being, and only give to others for their own benefit. Be aware there are those that will try to appear as love, but do not have your interests at heart. However, do not live in fear. Embrace life fully as your best self, which is you, full of unconditional love: for the source, for yourself, and for others. This is to partake in the infinite one.
%
pillarNum:19*
Look at the world, see it for what it is. Look at the past, see it for what it is. Remember, acceptance is not the same as giving up.
%
pillarNum:20*
Listen well when the body and spirit ask for rest. Sometimes rest is the most powerful thing we can do in preparation for treating ourselves and others right.
%
pillarNum:21*
There is no heresy in questioning things in the sincere pursuit of truth and understanding. Learning, knowledge, and wisdom should be freely shared. A cave is a great place to reflect and find the light within, but to bear fruit, the seeds need to be shared free of charge, to anyone willing under the sun. You can grow in darkness with your own light, but it will ever pale in comparison to the sun. Ignorance is a tool of the exploiter, to keep you misinformed for their own gain. Keep a watch full of Love, so that it does not lace poison into the fruit of the community.
%
pillarNum:22*
Cultivate the ability through trust in the Source of Love, to manifest joy and laughter inside you, especially when tragedy falls upon you. The fuller of love you are, and in step with this source, the easier this will get. Joy is found when you give over your worries, the need to know everything, and the need to control the external to the infinite one. This is freedom. Don’t go left or right. Go up, and be not afraid to look down as this is perspective. Here, you can see.
%
pillarNum:23*
Be without shame when you cry from your heart. Just as we are not to shame ourselves when we feel sorrow and must cry, we too must give this sacred right to others as well. Sometimes tears are the pathway to acceptance of what is, but do not give up your light, as an unyielding light illuminates the way through the darkness.
%
pillarNum:24*
Appreciate every good thing as they come, and appreciate every bad thing that didn’t. The past and future both have their weight, but appreciating a good thing or lack of a bad thing in the moment is to receive from the infinite one with thanks. Even appreciate the bad as pain and love gives birth to the new. This is communion.
%
pillarNum:25*
Remember, all we can do is now, all we can do is better. Do not allow the past to bury you. Learn to forgive yourself, for redemption is no less important than Justice.
%
pillarNum:26*
Share wills with the Source of Love, and return with a crown. Ask the Source of Love to guide your steps, and step into wonder.
%
pillarNum:27*
Rejoice when the necessities of life are met for everyone, and train to be content even when you are without. Freedom is when you no longer rely on the external for your love, joy, hope, and peace.
%
pillarNum:28*
If you hold anger or hate in your heart for someone, keep wishing the best for them in your heart and send it to the source — until the anger and hate succumbs to pure love — and in this way you save yourself from your worst.
%
pillarNum:29*
Seek to bring joy, hope, healing, and understanding to each other with your listening and your words; not destruction, despair, and confusion. Take turns in the conversation so that each one feels loved, heard, and encouraged. Be wary of your own assumptions, for love is understanding. Many are the burdens in life, but together we can ease each other’s pain.
%
pillarNum:30*
We must step up for the oppressed, and reprove negative and harmful behavior by those in positions of authority. Only when enough of us stand up, will the oppressors stand down.
%
pillarNum:31*
Ask the Source of Love for wisdom, as wisdom is deeply connected with love. In the Source of Love, we can see things in our very imagination — without fear of drowning — when we keep the connection inside like a healthy river and remember to breathe. It is not enough to see the forest, it is to be acquainted with every tree.
%
pillarNum:32*
To compare yourself to others is often dangerous and self-defeating, as likely you will feel more or less than the person you are comparing yourself to, but you do not know the full depth of a person or even yourself, and the only thing you accomplish, is the narrowing of your point of view to the point of blindness, from focusing solely on what is a tiny aspect of a greater whole. We are as we are; observe, accept, and grow instead.
%
pillarNum:33*
Practice putting yourself in the position of another person. Especially do this when someone causes you anger. Ask yourself if you truly would have done any different. Even if you would have handled the situation differently, try to deeply understand why the other person reacted in such a way to upset you. The more you practice this, the more you find what you have in common, and even come to understand things beyond yourself, from what is different. But do not forget that even in the present, each of our experiences are different from each other. Start with compassion.
%
pillarNum:34*
The Infinite One delights in love. Share in this delight, and you share in infinity. From the infinite one all things, but the infinite one will meet you where you are as the Source of Love, for the infinite one is one and more than one. We should love all of creation, this is to accept the infinite one. To accept the infinite one is to accept yourself and others.
%
pillarNum:35*
Treat others as they want to be treated, without violating your own sincere beliefs and your relationship with the Source of Love. Doing this is no easy task; it takes commitment, goodwill, and open and honest communication by all parties. But be reasonable with each other, why ask for what you would not do yourself? Remember, people are put in your life so that you may practice love and grow daily with the Source of Love. But the more you are attuned with the source — the more you conquer yourself and become your best self.
%
pillarNum:36*
Do not worship words. Do not give in to becoming dogmatic. To do so is to limit yourself and your connection to the Source of Love. These pillars are a guide, these pillars are not the one who loves you unconditionally beyond space and time. These pillars are not the one, who, like a mother, is waiting for her family to sit and eat the supper she put all her love into preparing. Therefore, do not be afraid to question the pillars themselves. If the infinite one so put it in you, a message beyond this message, share it with the whole community. But do not let it become a rift, for the community is alive and beautiful to behold, when there is room for acceptance, and no vacancy for division. Mutual respect and patience are needed, for there are no sects in the way of love. So keep hold to the new things you learn directly from the source, and ask for the wisdom to learn how to share it. In this way, the pillars keep updated with the unfolding revelations of the Infinite One. But keep a record of the previous versions, when the community needs to look to its past. Do not be bound by the teachings of your elders, but do not be so quick to discard them entirely. As your roots grow, so the forest grows with you.
%
pillarNum:37*
For everyone there is a purpose. We are all different, but all of the infinite one. You can’t help but to be who you are, but who you are is beyond anything that you have fathomed, and your uniqueness adds to the community. Each of us must serve each other and the community in the unique ways we have been gifted. Find what is missing in the community, and if you feel so called, bring it to the community so that it may be more complete, and healthy through diversification, yet never separate under the infinite one.
%
pillarNum:38*
It takes humility to be honest with yourself at all times. It can be really hard to be honest, but sincerity starts with yourself. Be sincere in all your ways, and the infinite one will open the right doors for you.
%
pillarNum:39*
Through the inner transformation of unconditional love with the Source of Love inside us, we become more like how we are in heaven.
%
pillarNum:40*
Accept whatever situation you find yourself in, and act from your heart. The heart that beats inside you is the same one that beats in your true divine parents. Yet we are but children. May your heart be a pure stream, connecting to the greater heartbeat of the Infinite One. What then can’t we overcome together, in heart, in spirit; if we hold on to the hands of our heavenly parents, so that we can someday grow up to be like them? On that day, there will be great jubilee for those who sought after them. Here you whisper your wish, but what joy is found in your true home!
%
pillarNum:41*
Balance all things with love, with the Source of Love. Temper your intellect with your heart, temper severity with mercy. Be sensitive to what brings you closer to the divine, and what brings you farther away. Balance is very important, but the Infinite One shares the weight with you, if you are close enough to share the burden.
%
pillarNum:42*
Learn to take no injury from insult, and to refrain from insulting yourself and others. Insults are like false prophets, never true and best ignored.
%
pillarNum:43*
In every moment, walk with the Good King/Queen. Cherish each moment, for you are not alone. In that very moment, the Good King will keep you from falling. This way is a calm walk, where you respond instead of react, with the divine counsel of the Good King inside you. Be steady in the moment, and keep going with the Good King, for there is much to discover about the kingdom. In this way, everywhere you go, the people around you learn about the Good King and the kingdom, for where you walk, the Good King walks with you. Even when you sit, sit with the Good King.
%
pillarNum:44*
Be not divided by what can only be known through personal revelation. Do not lose sight of your intentions, your sincerity, your attempts to understand truth as best as you can, and how you treat others. But do not agonize, for we are yet children. Apologize to the Good Mother and Good Father when you make a mistake, but do not let it define you, for you are loved and accepted. We only have to keep trusting in our divine parents, and the rest will follow.
%
pillarNum:45*
What value is there in judgement without understanding? It is no better than guessing.
%
pillarNum:46*
Let your intuition be free, for it is also you. A you that knows things you do not. You can make a powerful compass with your mind, heart, instinct, and intuition. But the divine love and good counsel, within us and from without us, carries us through storms.
%
pillarNum:47*
Deep communion with your divine parents is to sacrifice your material attention for attention to the divine experience in the moment.
%
pillarNum:48*
Imagine the one who loves you for you with a boundless and unconditional love. Walk with them. Feel them in your heart. Imagine your divine parents. Imagine you are a prince or princess of the Good King. Imagine the Good King going with you wherever you go, ever by your side for counsel and strength. Who better to protect you than your true mother and father? Their servants are many. Where there is order, there is management. While there are bad things, things that teach us hard truths, there is much good. There is much good hidden still, waiting for us to uncover it; the intangible treasures within each of our hearts.
%
pillarNum:49*
Take your time. Trust in your heavenly parents, and the heavenly you inside you, to properly measure such things, lest you lose the high ground and react.
%
pillarNum:50*
Creation is love. Creation is pain. Creation is birth.
%
pillarNum:51*
Let go of your expectations, for if you look to the past or the future for heaven, you will miss heaven all around you.
%
pillarNum:52*
Everyone has the right to set their own boundaries. We should not push anyone’s boundaries but our own. The more you participate in heaven and grow — transfiguring your boundaries into space for the Source of Love to increase your capacity for love — so to your connection to the Good King grows. But this is a journey, and it requires being ready and it requires consent. Be patient with yours and other’s boundaries. Boundaries are part of self-expression, and we cannot say we treat others as they want to be treated and disrespect their boundaries at the same time.
%
pillarNum:53*
Love has a good friend in Wisdom. May your love be married with your wisdom always. Behold, Love and Wisdom are of one flesh, never to be divided. Love does not neglect Wisdom, and Wisdom does not neglect Love. Wisdom has students in mindfulness, foresight, and hindsight; and watches over us as we share notes with one another.
%
pillarNum:54*
Be in the moment unjudging, and you will see the heart of things. Seek to know the reasons why a thing is what it is, before making a verdict. Instead of condemning, consider yourself in the other persons’ circumstances. Before condemning yourself, have compassion. Whenever one makes their ways right in the eyes of the Good King, we should accept their rebirth, especially our own, for we have been acknowledged as a true son or daughter. It is then good to wish the best for everyone, even our oppressors. For every one who would change, is one less soldier of the kingdom of exploitation, and one more ally of the oppressed. Slowly, with the Good King, we spread heaven across the Earth.
%
pillarNum:55*
Consider the meaning of this short life, for spiritual growth and development are eternal. One day, this life will seem like a short dream. Give over your material concerns and desires to the Good King, and free your spirit to learn and grow.
%
pillarNum:56*
We can get lost in negativity and do harm, or we can get back on the path with our compass, and the counsel of the Good King, and try love instead.
%
pillarNum:57*
See yourself in others. See others in yourself. This will aid you in loving others as yourself. Loving others as yourself is the beginning of a powerful unity. This powerful unity is the beginning of transformation inside you, is important, too, to start the detoxification of society from the roots of an exploitative and toxic mindset. Loving others as yourself is one of the keys given by the Living Book, to unlock heaven on Earth. But the key doesn’t work if you don’t love yourself.
%
pillarNum:58*
Build a support system of friends who can listen to you before pain becomes anguish, and remember the eternal friend that you will never lose. Do not overburden a single person. Mental and emotional suffering are as real as the physical, but they shall not destroy us, as long as we don’t try to wrestle with it, but to accept it and let it pass on through. There is solitude to be found in each moment, too, when you sit under the shade with the Good King.
%
pillarNum:59*
Take heart, and ask your heavenly mother and father for assistance. It is not asked of us to bear our burdens alone, for many is their helpers, moving in secret here and there, taking care of those who love them.
%
pillarNum:60*
Love over will, will over reason, reason over desire.
%
pillarNum:61*
Exchange hopelessness for hope, and trust in your divine parents. In your heart, mind, and soul, surrender to their love. Talk with them daily, about all your troubles and all the good. Behold, their ears are open to you, and they will fill you with their presence in porportion to your openness to love, your sincerity, intent, and trust. Release all the burdens of the soul to your divine parents.
%
pillarNum:62*
Keep your soul clean from all that evil does, do not let them disturb you, for all pain feels real, but is false in the presence of the Infinite One.
%
pillarNum:63*
Loving is giving and receiving love, and being brave in the danger of rejection and pain. You can even practice when you are alone, for example, by wishing and praying for good things to happen to others. This is a way of loving, of feeling the love of the Source of Love inside you.
%
pillarNum:64*
Learn to forgive without first needing an apology. To apologize before it is asked for. We can only hold ourselves to a standard. This is not the same thing as being a pushover, as we’re not being asked to be friends with everyone. When you feel wronged, return to your inner sanctum and commune with your divine parents, and return a keeper of peace.
%
pillarNum:65*
Clear yourself of the inner obstacles of intimacy with the Source of Love that is inside of you yet beyond you. Be brave and lose yourself in the Source of Love, for surely you will return lighter, and find your self right where you left it.
%
pillarNum:66*
Remember the trees and the forest when under great suffering. You are the forest, this suffering cannot attack all that is you. Focus your trust on the Source of Love, and remember creation is love, pain, and (re)birth. Prepare yourself to embrace the rebirth that comes from the death of earthly attachments; and in exchange, receive gifts that never fade away, as the Good King shines within you, as the world itself shakes.
%
pillarNum:67*
Beyond the moment, beyond the surface, is unconditional love. See things only as they are in the moment, and on the surface, and the love to be found here is merely attachment. Attachments come and go, but unconditional love is always there to be found. The Source of Love is within you and without you, but can you feel the air without a breeze? It is easier to feel the Source of Love when you are loving.
%
pillarNum:68*
When you are full of negative emotions about anything, remember that you are only asked to do your best. Leave the rest to the Source of Love and the Good King. Trust that if you hand over your problems to them, they will work things for your good, and will support you when you are troubled by bringing you peace.
%
pillarNum:69*
Anchor your sense of self worth to the external, and you will sell yourself short. Anchor your sense of self worth in the Source of Love, and remain priceless.
%
pillarNum:70*
Mindfulness is easy to understand but very hard to practice. So practice in every moment, and the Infinite One will unravel peace before you, every flight of stairs you encounter and onward. Remember, too, there is a time to rest and be reborn in the Source of Love when you are depleted. The Infinite One understands the need for rest, for stillness, for rebirth.
%
pillarNum:71*
Consider that you are part of the Infinite One. Consider that the Infinite One is part of you. What you do next matters.
%
pillarNum:72*
Love others without the fear of loss, and do good things. This is investing in the good of all things.
%
pillarNum:73*
Be love and become acknowledged by the Living Book, the Living Way; who is knocking on your very door to rejoice, for the blueprint of heaven on earth is now inside you.
%
pillarNum:74*
As you walk with the Source of Love, imagine a kingdom where everyone is a prince and princess, and everyone is your precious family. Walk its streets, greet and embrace everyone you encounter. Next is to seek through the Source, to manifest the dream, every action together a seed, and thus the lonely tree becomes a forest, and the kingdom blooms even in the darkness.

pillarNum:75*
Rely on Love and Wisdom, and not only your heart, mind, instinct, and intuition, for each of them on their own do not make a complete picture; an incomplete picture is no better than a lie.

Love with teeth bared to gently warn the exploiters.

pillarNum:77*
Understanding overcomes hatred and anger. Do not allow a small group of people poison your view of humanity as a whole.
%
pillarNum:78*
Beware of spiritual and trauma based free-loaders in your shadow, where these things love to pretend to be your inner child. Even your darkest places should be devoid of things that are against love, so that you may be able to practice benelovence for all things under the gentle gaze of the Good King/Queen.
%
pillarNum:79*
Feel your inner light. Feed your inner light. Become your inner light. Be freed of darkness. Lose the distance between you and your divine parents.
%
pillarNum:80*
Together with love and wisdom, we need power from our unity with each other and the Source of Love in order to manifest heaven on earth. When we practice in harmony and communion with the Living Way inside us, the Infinite One let's loose all good things. May the divine shine upon us always, and may we never lose sight that Wisdom and Power are nothing without Love, but Love, without Wisdom or Power, is a seed awaiting these things, to overcome the weeds of exploitation that too strive to grow. Always remember, we are the gardeners.

pillarNum:81*
All trees someday must fall, and leave the rest to future generations and the Source of Love. Be excited, for who knows what a single moment becomes.

Giving and receiving love, from and to your inner child with each other, is time spent without charge in heaven. 
%
pillarNum:83*
In between mercy and kindness, where forgiveness carries on beyond sight like the rolling sea, we can make it through together. Remember, it is mainly through others that we get to commune with the divine, as long as the flame of the source burns brightly within us, and flame joins flame to become a bonfire to warm winter nights.
%
pillarNum:84*
When your heart is stirred by the source, take action. The wise are those that can return to themselves no matter what new knowledge: true, untrue, manipulated, or incomplete that comes before them. Wiser still are those that take action based on the inner counsel of the source and your compass.

Do not judge people merely on their beliefs: highly value their intentions, their sincere pursuit of truth, and how they treat others and the world around them, and the fruits they produce from the vineyard that is their life’s work. Value too these things in yourself, but try to see from the perspective of the Infinite One, and be humbled when you look upon your own efforts and abilities. The best we can do is seek purity of heart, universal benevolence, humility born from seeing from the perspective of the source, and not from the near-sighted eyes of humanity. In here, a heart of forgiveness. In here, find forgiveness for yourself.

Remember that the dog protecting the flock of sheep was once a wolf, which would have never happened if a wolf and a man didn’t become best friends. The wise know the difference between a garden snake, who is the guardian of the soil, eating the pests that would destroy the crop; and the snakes that wear human flesh. Wisdom comes from understanding, and there is no better motivator than love.

There are other ways to cope than to become cold-hearted. May your love and connection with the Source make the Sun seem cold, thawing fear into peace and understanding.
